=== REALITY DEBUGGER - FINAL ASSEMBLY ===

You've found the hidden archive. Impressive.

FLAG FORMAT: 0DAY{...} (UPPERCASE!)

DECODING SEQUENCE:
1. Artist field: 5a52454f4a4b663d
   Decode: Hex -> ASCII -> ROT13 (reverse) -> Base64 (decode) -> Part 1

2. Software field: =YBPmE3D
   Decode: Reverse string -> Base64 (decode) -> XOR with key "MATRIX" -> Part 2

3. Copyright field: lQdyTFoWTAFyaFdOHH6CHa4=
   Decode: Caesar cipher (-7) -> Base64 (decode) -> Zlib decompress -> Part 3

4. UserComment field: TUQ1OmEwOTEzNWU2OTQxZmFkNTkuLi4=
   Decode: Base64 (decode) -> Extract MD5 hash
   BRUTEFORCE: MD5 hash is of the format "R3[a-z0-9]1ty}" 
   Full MD5: a09135e6941fad5972f992337064bb32
   You need to crack or reverse-lookup the MD5 to get Part 4

FINAL FLAG ASSEMBLY:
Part1 + Part2 + Part3 + Part4 = Full Flag

Expected result: 0DAY{B0rn_t0_d36u9_R3a1ty}

Layers to discover:
1. EXIF metadata (4 encoded parts)
2. LSB steganography (decoding hints)
3. Polyglot file (this ZIP archive)
4. Multiple fake flags (ignore them!)

Good luck, debugger.
